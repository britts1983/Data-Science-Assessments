# Problem Defnition

## Introduction

This capstone project on ’Movie recommendation system??? predicts the movie rating by a user based on users past rating of movies. The dataset used for this purpose can be found in the following links. 

The challenge is not so easy given that there are many different type of biases present in the movie reviews. It can be different social, psychological, demographic variations that changes the taste of every single users for a given particular movie. However the problem can still be designed to tackle major biases which can be expressed via mathematical equations relatively easily. The idea here is to develop a model which can effectively predict movie recommendations for a given user without our judgement being impaired due to different biases. In the algorithm, the prevalences can be suppressed using some clever mathematical tricks. This will become clear as we follow this document.
