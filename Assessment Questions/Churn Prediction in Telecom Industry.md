# Churn Prediction in Telecom Industry using Logistic Regression

## Introduction

According to EuropeanBusinessReview, telecommunication providers lose close to $65 million a month from customer churn. Isnâ€™t that expensive? With many emerging telecom giants, the competition in the telecom sector is increasing and the chances of customers discontinuing a service are high. This is often referred to as Customer Churn in Telecom. Telecommunication providers that focus on quality service, lower-cost subscription plans, availability of content and features whilst creating positive customer service experiences have high chances of customer retention. The good news is that all these factors can be measured with different layers of data about billing history, subscription plans, cost of content, network/bandwidth utilization, and more to get a 360-degree view of the customer. This 360-degree view of customer data can be leveraged for predictive analytics to identify patterns and various trends that influence customer satisfaction and help reduce churn in telecom.

Considering that customer churn in telecom is expensive and inevitable, leveraging analytics to understand the factors that influence customer attrition, identifying customers that are most likely to churn, and offering them discounts can be a great way to reduce it. In this data science project, you will build a logistic regression machine learning model to understand the correlation between the different variables in the dataset and customer churn. This end-to-end churn prediction machine learning model using R will tweak the problem of unsatisfied customers and make the revenue flowing for the telecom company.

In this beginner-level data science project, you will perform Market Basket Analysis in Python using Apriori and FP Growth Algorithm based on association rules to discover hidden insights on how to improve product recommendations for customers. You will learn to apply various metrics like Support, Lift, and Confident to evaluate the association rules.
