# Pairwise Reviews Ranking- Sentiment Analysis of Product Reviews

## Introduction

Product reviews from users are the key for businesses to make strategic decisions as they give an in-depth understanding of what the users actually want for a better experience. Today, almost all businesses have reviews and rating section on their website to understand if a userâ€™s experience has been positive, negative, or neutral. With an overload of puzzling reviews and feedback on the product, it is not possible to read each of those reviews manually. Not only this, most of the time the feedback has many shorthand words and spelling mistakes that could be difficult to decipher. This is where sentiment analysis comes to the rescue

In this data science project, you will use a natural language processing technique to pre-process and extract relevant features from the reviews and rating dataset. Use semi-supervised learning methodology to apply the pairwise ranking approach to rank reviews and also further segregate them to perform sentiment analysis. The developed model will help businesses maximize user satisfaction efficiently by prioritizing product updates that are likely to have the most positive impact.
