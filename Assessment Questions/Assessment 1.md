# Building a Chatbot with Python

## Introduction

Do you remember the last time you spoke to a customer service associate on call or via chat for an incorrect item delivered to you from Amazon, Flipkart, or Walmart? Most likely you would have had a conversation with a chatbot instead of a customer service agent. Gartner estimates that 85% of customer interactions will be handled by chatbots by 2022. So what exactly is a chatbot? How can you build an intelligent chatbot using Python? rocket launch. 

## What is a Chatbot? 

A chatbot is an AI-based digital assistant that can understand human capabilities and simulate human conversations in natural language to give prompt answers to their questions just like a real human would. Chatbots help businesses increase their operational efficiency by automating customer requests.

The most important task of a chatbot is to analyze and understand the intent of a customer request to extract relevant entities. The bot then delivers an appropriate response to the user based on the analysis. Natural language processing plays a vital role in text analytics through chatbots making the interaction between the computer and human feel like a real human conversation. Every chatbot works by adopting the following three classification methods-

Pattern Matching – Makes use of pattern matches to group the text and produce a response

Natural Language Understanding (NLU) – The process of converting textual information into a structured data format that a machine can understand.

Natural Language Generation (NLG) – The process of transforming the structured data into text.

## How to build your own chatbot?
In this data science project, you will use a leading and powerful Python library NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) to work with text data.

Import the required data science libraries and load the data.

Use various pre-processing techniques like Tokenization and Lemmatization to pre-process the textual data.

Create training and test data.

Create a simple set of rules to train the chatbot.

Yay! It’s time to interact with your chatbot.
