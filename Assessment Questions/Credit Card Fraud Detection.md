# Credit Card Fraud Detection as a Classification Problem

## Introduction

This is an interesting data science problem for data scientists, who want to get out of their comfort zone by tackling classification problems by having a large imbalance in the size of the target groups. Credit Card Fraud Detection is usually viewed as a classification problem with the objective of classifying the transactions made on a particular credit card as fraudulent or legitimate. There are not enough credit card transaction datasets available for practice as banks do not want to reveal their customer data due to privacy concerns.

## Business Problem
This data science project aims to help data scientists develop an intelligent credit card fraud detection model for identifying fraudulent credit card transactions from highly imbalanced and anonymous credit card transactional datasets. To solve this project related to data science, the popular Kaggle dataset containing credit card transactions made in September 2013 by European cardholders. This credit card transactional dataset consists of 284,807 transactions of which 492 (0.172%) transactions were fraudulent. It is a highly unbalanced dataset as the positive class i.e. the number of frauds accounts only for 0.172% of all the credit card transactions in the dataset. There are 28 anonymized features in the dataset that are obtained by feature normalization using principal component analysis. There are two additional features in the dataset that have not been anonymized â€“ the time when the transaction was made and the amount in dollars. This will help detect the overall cost of fraud.
